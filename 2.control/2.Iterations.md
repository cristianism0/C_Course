# Iterations

Previously we saw about `for` iterations, which follows this generic construction.
```c
for (clause1, condition2, expression3) secondary-block
```  

Where `clause 1` is often a assignment expression of a variable declaration. The `condition2` gives limit to executions and 
`expression3` update the variable on `clause1`

### While and Do

```c
while (condition) secondary-block
do secondary-block while (condition);
```

Here's a example of a `while` aplication to calculate _Heron Approximation_:
```c
#include <tgmath.h>

constexpr double 𝜀 = 1E-9;      //precision

double const a = 34.0;
double x = 0.5;
while (fabs(1.0 - a*x) >= 𝜀) {  //iterates util close
x *= (2.0 - a*x);               //Heron aproximation
} 
```

`While` iterates as long as the given condition is `True`. The `do` is similar, but its evaluates _after_ the _secondary-block_:

```c
do {                            // Iterates
x *= (2.0 - a*x);               // Heron approximation
} while (fabs(1.0 - a*x) >= 𝜀); // Iterates until close
```

This means that, `do` will execute its block once after the condition is false.

For more control we can use `break` and `continue` statements.
- `break`    -> stops the loop immediately.
- `continue` -> skips the rest of the secondary-block, getting back for loop and re-evaluates the condition.

### Some Practices
> In C, the `while (true)` is often written as `for (;;)`;
