# Conditional Execution

The `if` keyword.
```c
if (i > 25) {
    j = i - 25;
}
```

This interation is composed by:
- `(i > 25)` -> Conditional Expression 
- `{...}`    -> Second Block

The same composition of **for loop**. Also, if has a general form:
```c
if (i > 25) {
    j = i - 25;
} else {
    j = i;
}
```

Here we have **two seconday block**, the firs one, after the conditional expression is execute if the expression is **True**.
If not, the second block after _else_ is executed. This composition is called **_selection statement_**, general form is:
```c
if (condition) secondary-block0
else secondary-block1
 ```

### Evaluation of a Numerical Condition

> In C, the Value 0 is _logical false_
>
> Any Value different of 0 is `true`.

For test the equality and inequality of a expression, we use these operators: `==` and `!=`:
- `a == b` is `True` when the value of a is equals to the value of b.
- `a != b` is `True` when the value of a is _different_ of the value of b.

For example:
```c
if (i != 0) {}   
// has the condition with the same value as:
if (i) {}

//both are True.
```

For `True` and `False` values, we can store in `boolean type` variables. //for older versions, we use `<stdbool.h>`
