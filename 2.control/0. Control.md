# About Control
About control we talks about the flow of a program. On the chapter 1 we saw about `functions`, a way to transfer control.
The _function call_ transfer the control to the function, the _return_ transfer back to the caller.

The _for_ has a _conditional transference_ that regulates the if the second block should be executed or no.

C has **five** conditional control statements: `if`, `for`, `do`, `while` and `switch`.
