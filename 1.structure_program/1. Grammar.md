# Grammar - Syntactical Aspects
## Classification
- **Special Words** -> Used in pontuals cases.
    ```c
    #include 
    int 
    maybe_unused 
    char 
    void 
    double 
    for 
    return
    ```
- **Punctuation** -> Puctuation are used for structure the program, separating statements and ordering them.
```c
Brackets types: {. . . }, (. . . ), [. . . ], [[. . . ]], /*. . . */, and <. . . >

Separators or Terminators: Comma and Semicolon.
Comma: Separates arguments.
Semicolon: Separates statements.
```
- **Comments** ->
Uses the `/*.../*` or `//`. Comments are used for _documentation_ of the program. Explaining it.

- **Literals** -> Items that refer to fixed values.
```c
0, 1, 2, 3, E+25, 0.004,
"%zu, %g, \t, \n"
```
- **Identifiers** -> *"Names"* that we (or C) gives to certain entities of a program.
    1. Variables or Data objects
    2. Types aliases, like: `size_t` where `_t` is a *convertion*.
    3. Functions
    4. Constants

- **Functions** -> Composed by statements, execute a task. Most part of the functions is *defined* and has a *function body: {...}* where is writen the statements.

- **Operators** -> C uses a few ones:
    1. = for *initialization or assignment*
    2. < for comparion
    3. ++ to *increment a variable*
    4. * to multiply values

- **Attributes** -> Writen inside double brackets: `[[]]`, used for suplemmental informations.
