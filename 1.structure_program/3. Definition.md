# Definition
>***Disambiguation:** Declarations specify **identifiers**, whereas definitions specify **objects**.*

## Initialization
A initialization is the proccess that provides to a identifier a value *(declares a variable)*, we will **ALWAYS** initialize our variables.
```c
size_t i = 0;
```
for example.

This gives `i` the initial value of 0. This process also **defines** the object with the correspondig name. This instructs the compiler to provide storage in which the value of the variable **can be stored**.

> An object is defined at the same time it is initialized.

An Array of $n$ items will have $n$ initializations:
```c
double A[5] = {
    [0] = 1.8,
    [1] = 2.4,
    [2] = 68.4,
    [3] = 3.E+25,
    [4] = 0.00007,
};
``` 
This form of initializer is called `designated`. Each indice of this array has it's own value assigned. If any position has no
assignment it's set to 0.
> Missing elements in initializers default to 0. -> `Zero Initialization`

Attetion to the array indices, they all start with 0 index and goes to n-1 index.

To a program be **consitent**, each object of function has to have exactly **ONE** definition.
